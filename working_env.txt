This file holds the current working environment for this project, please add to this if you need to install other packages etc.  
The preference for a package manager is anaconda then pip.  At present we will simply use the below command for creating packages, but from time to time Matt Hanson will also 
freeze the environment by creating an environment.yml file.   

conda create  --channel conda-forge --name slmacc numpy pandas matplotlib netcdf4 scipy pytables psutil xlrd geopandas pyyaml openpyxl

The choice for python 3.7 is based on the changes made in 3.8 which makes it harder to work with DLLS. I need this functionallity to run the pasture growth model.
If you have any concerns with regards to this environement, please contact Matt@komanawa.com

see: SLMMAC_environment.yml for direct export of the used environment.

conda install -c conda-forge scikit-learn for the pca and clustering
